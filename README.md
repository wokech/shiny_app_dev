## App 1: Nairobi Land Prices
The purpose of this Shiny App is to present land price information for Nairobi and its satellite towns. 
The data is provided by HassConsult Limited through the HassConsult Land Index (quarterly publication).

## App 2: Kenya National Parks Visitor Data
This app was developed to provide insights into the visitor number data (for Kenyan National Parks) over a specified period of time.
The data source is the Kenya Parks Investments Prospectus (2023).
